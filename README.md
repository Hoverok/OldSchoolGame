# OldSchoolGame
A very messy, but a (working!) skeleton of a an old school style game.  I used it for experimental purposes to get a better grasp of objects, inheritance and windows.h library 
Langas is a based and Logus is a derived class
Langas' methods only draw the map, having no in game movement logic
Logus' methods are responsible for player in game movement logic
"Structure file.txt" holds the logical structure of the map that is into Logus via one of its methods
